    <h2>About myself</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Nurai. I am 17 years old. I am into drawing. I like cats and watch anime. Also I like to sing
        but
        my skills are not so good..
        I'm learning English. In the future I would like to learn Korean. I want to become a good programmer. But
        sometimes I think that
        I am the most stupid person in the world, hehe, but I will try. In the future I want to travel a lot. The
        countries I like: USA, Korea,
        France and Japan.</p>
